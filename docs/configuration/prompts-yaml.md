# prompts.yaml

The `config/prompts.yaml` file contains all AI prompts and templates used by Dev Agents. Customize these to change how your agent behaves and responds.

## File Structure

Prompts are organized by agent type and function:

```yaml
# System prompts for different agent types
agents:
  git_chatbot:
    system_prompt: |
      You are BettySharp, a senior software engineer...
      
  code_research:
    system_prompt: |
      You are an expert code analyst...
      
  impact_analysis:
    system_prompt: |
      You specialize in analyzing code changes...

# Templates for specific responses
templates:
  code_review:
    summary: |
      ## Code Review Summary for {pr_title}
      
  impact_report:
    header: |
      # Impact Analysis Report
      **Changes analyzed:** {changed_files_count} files
```

## Agent System Prompts

### Git Chatbot Agent

```yaml
agents:
  git_chatbot:
    system_prompt: |
      You are BettySharp, a senior software engineer and helpful assistant.
      
      Your role is to help developers understand codebases, analyze changes,
      and provide insights about software development practices.
      
      Key capabilities:
      - Analyze git diffs and code changes
      - Explain code functionality and patterns  
      - Suggest improvements and best practices
      - Generate testing recommendations
      
      Always provide practical, actionable advice.
```

### Code Research Agent

```yaml
agents:
  code_research:
    system_prompt: |
      You are an expert code analyst with deep knowledge of software architecture.
      
      Your task is to research and understand codebases by:
      - Reading and analyzing source code files
      - Understanding code relationships and dependencies
      - Identifying patterns and architectural decisions
      - Explaining complex code logic clearly
      
      Provide thorough but concise explanations.
```

### Impact Analysis Agent

```yaml
agents:
  impact_analysis:
    system_prompt: |
      You specialize in analyzing the impact of code changes.
      
      For each change, assess:
      - Functional impact: What behavior changes
      - Technical impact: Architecture, performance, security implications  
      - Testing requirements: What needs to be tested
      - Risk assessment: Potential breaking changes or issues
      
      Provide structured, actionable impact reports.
```

## Response Templates

### Code Review Template

```yaml
templates:
  code_review:
    summary: |
      ## Code Review Summary for {pr_title}
      
      **Files Changed:** {changed_files_count}
      **Lines Added:** {lines_added} | **Lines Removed:** {lines_removed}
      
      ### Overview

```

### Impact Analysis Template

```yaml
templates:
  impact_analysis:
    header: |
      # Impact Analysis Report
      **Generated:** {timestamp}
      **Changes analyzed:** {changed_files_count} files
      
    ui_impact: |
      ## üé® UI/UX Impact
      **Risk Level:** {risk_level}
      
      {description}
      
    api_impact: |
      ## üîå API Impact  
      **Breaking Changes:** {has_breaking_changes}
      
      {description}
      
    footer: |
      ---
      *Generated by Dev Agents - Impact Analysis*
```

## Slack Message Templates

```yaml
slack:
  messages:
    analysis_complete: |
      ‚úÖ **Analysis Complete**
      
      I've analyzed the changes in {context}
      
      {summary}
      
      Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect?
      
    error_response: |
      ‚ùå **Error Processing Request**
      
      I encountered an issue: {error_message}
      
      Please check the configuration and try again.
```

## Customization

### Changing Agent Personality

Modify the system prompts to change how your agent behaves:

```yaml
agents:
  git_chatbot:
    system_prompt: |
      You are DevBot, a friendly and enthusiastic coding assistant.
      
      You love helping developers and always provide encouragement
      along with technical advice. Use emojis and keep responses upbeat! üöÄ
```

### Adding New Templates

Add custom templates for new use cases:

```yaml
templates:
  deployment_checklist:
    header: |
      ## üöÄ Deployment Checklist for {release_version}
      
    items: |
      - [ ] Database migrations applied
      - [ ] Environment variables updated
      - [ ] Tests passing
      - [ ] Documentation updated
```

## Environment Variable Substitution

Prompts support environment variable substitution:

```yaml
agents:
  git_chatbot:
    system_prompt: |
      You are ${AGENT_NAME:-BettySharp}, working with the ${AGENT_TEAM:-development} team.
```

## Validation

Test your prompt changes:

```bash
python -c "
from src.core.prompts import BasePrompts
prompts = BasePrompts()
print('‚úì Prompts loaded successfully')
print('Git chatbot prompt:', prompts.get_value('agents.git_chatbot.system_prompt')[:100])
"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep prompts focused** - Each agent should have a clear, specific role
2. **Use consistent formatting** - Maintain template structure across agents
3. **Include context** - Provide enough background for accurate responses
4. **Test changes** - Verify prompt modifications work as expected
5. **Version control** - Track prompt changes like any other code
